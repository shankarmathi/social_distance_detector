Eventhough the people are cautious in this regard, some monitoring and warning mechanisms are the need of the hour.  These surveillance &amp; warning system  should warn the people or the  Authorities in case some irregularities are found and should provide a comfort level to the people by ensuring their social distancing  in the public places.  Keeping in mind of the same, this project has been done so that it could work both in indoor and outdoor environments.  In this model, CCTV cameras have been used for people's counting along with their proximity. This data  is processed using the modules written in  python language. The output are given as  warning over speaker, intimation to authorities through email and electro-mechanical door operation.
